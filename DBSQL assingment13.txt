1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. 
Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
     
Ans:-select cname,city,'High Rating' rating from customers where rating >=200
     union
     select cname,city,'Low Rating' rating from customers where rating < 200;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order.
  Put the results in alphabetical order. 

Ans:-select  Sname,Cname,Cnum,Cnum from CUSTOMERS
     join SALESPEOPLE using(Snum)
     where CUSTOMERS.Snum in
     (select Snum from CUSTOMERS
     group by Snum
     having count(Snum) > 1)
     order by
     Sname,Cname;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the 
 second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
 (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.

Ans:-select Snum from SALESPEOPLE where City='San Jose'
     union
     select Cnum from CUSTOMERS where City='San Jose'
     union 
     select Onum from ORDERS where Odate like '%-10-03';
